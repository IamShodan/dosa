# Denial of Service abettor (DoSa)

Easy denial of service for people on the go.

This project already has an implementation [here](https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout).
This is my implementation of it, with additional features to come. Hopefully.

## Disclaimer
DoSa should only be used for educational purposes, or for testing with permission from the relevant authority.
